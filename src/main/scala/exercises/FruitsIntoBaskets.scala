   * The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
   *
   * You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
   * You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e.,
   * you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

   * Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
